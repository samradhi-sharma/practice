Some interesting things to remember for clearing the terminal in vscode type Ctrl L.



Developers create several branches in version control system like git as for each new feature to isolate the work.

This allows them to develop, test, and refine the feature without affecting the main codebase

A dedicated branch can be created for fixing bugs or for urgent "hotfixes" needed in production.

So like in this practice project I have

So to move from one branch to other we have command, suppose I want to move movies branch and then
